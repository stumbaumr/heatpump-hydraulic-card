# Custom text reference

This page describes `texts`, the configuration of your own installation. To add a language that is built in for everybody, including the editor, see [TRANSLATING.md](TRANSLATING.md).

`texts` is a nested YAML map keyed by lowercase language codes. Select one with `language`; missing entries always fall back to English. Existing English or German labels can also be overridden by defining `texts.en` or `texts.de`.

```yaml
language: nl
texts:
  nl:
    title: Warmtepomp
    modes:
      heating: Verwarming
```

Only the keys below are accepted. Every leaf must be a string. Values are rendered as plain text. Keep the named placeholders in translated strings:

- `{sources}` in `energy_missing`
- `{h}` in `timeline_title` and `timeline_aria`
